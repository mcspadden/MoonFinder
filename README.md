# MoonFinder
Reserves a first-class seat to the moon

The name MoonFinder comes from the popular ideology that BTC and/or cryptos as a whole will take us, the crypto community, to the moon. While some cryptos may be literally building a rocket to take us there, most are using the term moon as the cash out point. MoonFinder pulls user chosen data from CoinCap.io (limited to them as of now) and selects the best (numerical) coin to purchase. This is solely based off the coins gains in the last 365 days and does **not** indicate a profit will be made. See the MIT license below for the state of which MoonFinder is provided. 

_Seat Selector_ = a cryptocurrency
